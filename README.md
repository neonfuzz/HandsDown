My implementation of the Hands Down Gold Layout, as defined on [Alan Reiser's Hands Down website](https://sites.google.com/alanreiser.com/handsdown).

Code is largely my own, though heavily inspired by [Alan Reiser's own QMK implementation](https://github.com/moutis/HandsDown). That being said, `adaptive.c` is inspired more by [`replicaJunction`'s adaptive pull request](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/14034).
